![generated-image copy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b6dd690-afff-4bbf-95e6-e13e6c6cc6e6)


## 🎯 Problem Statement

Manual mortgage document review was a bottleneck—error-prone, labour-intensive and unable to scale—delaying approval cycles and degrading customer experience.

Led the design and delivery of a mission-critical document processing system for a financial services client, automating mortgage approvals and driving operational excellence with advanced ML.

## ⚙️ Technical Approach

* Modular Python microservices orchestrated by CrewAI for specialised cognitive tasks  
* LangSmith integration for real-time monitoring, tracing and alerting  
* RESTful APIs with FastAPI; dependency management via Poetry  
* Containerised deployments on Docker and AWS for resilience and scalability  
* Dual-LLM verification pipeline to cross-validate extracted data
